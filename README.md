## BRRTools Helper

Usage:

- Clone this repo
- Copy a bunch of WAV files into the folder
- Run `00 RUN.bat`

This script will automatically run each of them through BRRTools and insert the correct loop point into the command-line arguments.

Feel free to tweak the script as you see fit!

To use this, you'll either need [KungFuFurby's fork](https://github.com/KungFuFurby/BRRtools) of BRRtools, or [Herringway's dlang port](https://github.com/Herringway/BRRtools).

Here's [a build I made](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2vvlw0kpe6tp1v9/brr_encoder.exe?dl=0)!
